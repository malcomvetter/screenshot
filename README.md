# screenshot

Build in Visual Studio

This is a reference example for how to capture a screenshot in Windows in C++, convert that screenshot from BMP (big file!) to PNG (small file!), and finally convert that PNG image to a base64 encoded string ... all without touching disk. 

Yes, there are a million examples of very similar (boilerplate MSDN) screenshots in C++, but all of them I found write the screenshot image to disk.
